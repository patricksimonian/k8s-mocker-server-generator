IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

 - `"Always"` means that kubelet always attempts to pull the latest image. Container will fail If the pull fails.
 - `"IfNotPresent"` means that kubelet pulls if the image isn't present on disk. Container will fail if the image isn't present and the pull fails.
 - `"Never"` means that kubelet never pulls an image, but only uses a local image. Container will fail if the image isn't present
