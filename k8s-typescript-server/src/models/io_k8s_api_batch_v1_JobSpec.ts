/**
* completionMode specifies how Pod completions are tracked. It can be `NonIndexed` (default) or `Indexed`.

`NonIndexed` means that the Job is considered complete when there have been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each Pod completion is homologous to each other.

`Indexed` means that the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1), available in the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index. The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. When value is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and `.spec.parallelism` must be less than or equal to 10^5. In addition, The Pod name takes the form `$(job-name)-$(index)-$(random-string)`, the Pod hostname takes the form `$(job-name)-$(index)`.

More completion modes can be added in the future. If the Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which is possible during upgrades due to version skew, the controller skips updates for the Job.

Possible enum values:
 - `"Indexed"` is a Job completion mode. In this mode, the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1). The Job is considered complete when a Pod completes for each completion index.
 - `"NonIndexed"` is a Job completion mode. In this mode, the Job is considered complete when there have been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Pod completions are homologous to each other.
